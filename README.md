### Abstract 
Genera with species of multiple ploidal levels provide models to understand successive rounds of whole genome duplication leading to intricate reticulate relationships of polyploid plant species. Here, we studied 17 polyploid taxa (species, subspecies, or varieties) in *Azorella* sections *Schizeilema* and *Stilbocarpa* (Apiaceae) that are mostly endemic to New Zealand. Species in these groups have diverse habits and leaf morphologies, distinct distributional ranges, and varying ploidal levels (4x, 6x, and 10x). Our goals were to determine the origins of the higher-level polyploids (6x and 10x), resolve species relationships, and assess the biogeography of the New Zealand *Azorella* species. We reconstructed a species tree from Hyb-Seq Angiosperms353 baits data for 131 individuals of all 17 taxa. We also reconstructed nrDNA and plastome phylogenies for 105 individuals using genome skim sequencing. Phylogenomic analysis of Hyb-Seq data using locus-based species trees and SNP-based approaches, together with comparison of nrDNA and plastome trees, showed that species diversification within New Zealand may relate to multiple origins from South America, which has been further shaped by additional rounds of polyploidy as well as hybridization or introgression. The two *Azorella* sections in New Zealand likely resulted from different biogeographic events from South America - one to the subantarctic islands (section Stilbocarpa) and a second to the South Island (section Schizeilema). In addition, within section *Schizeilema*, species have dispersed from the South Island (New Zealand) to Australia, the subantarctic islands, and the North Island (New Zealand). Our combined approach of phylogenomic analyses of plastome and nuclear locus-based data, together with SNP-based network approaches allowed us to determine the origins of some higher-level polyploids in New Zealand *Azorella* and revealed a more complex picture of historical and ongoing polyploidy and hybridization within these lineages. 


### Gene tree based  phylogeny inference 

We extracted Angiosperm353 loci via [HybPiper](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper) using target-enrichment sequencing, and high-copy marker of plastome and nrDNA were extracted via [Getorgenalla](https://github.com/Kinggerm/GetOrganelle). All bioinformatic were performed via New Zealand eScience Infrastructure [NeSI](https://www.nesi.org.nz/)
